- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @augustozb
- I am currently pursuing a MSc in Electrical Engineering at WSU-V 
- Currently my research efforts are on the effect of wildfires on renewable energy production,
-   and transmission/distribution system expansion planning under wildfire risk studies.
-   For that, I have been using both MATLAB/YALMIP, and more recently the Julia alongside with JuMP.  
- Feel free to send my an email: a.zaninbertoletti@wsu.edu
